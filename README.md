# parallel-matrix-tsh
This project presents a parallel matrix multiplication framework in C, built on a custom tuple space server (TSH) for distributed coordination. A streamlined API enables clean read/put/get tuple operations, decoupling computation from shell-based controls. The system features a master process that dynamically spawns worker processes, which execute tasks in parallel by communicating through tuple space. Granularity of task division is tunable, and fault tolerance is achieved via timeout-based reissuing and redundant result filtering.

Benchmarking scripts evaluate performance across matrix sizes and granularities, recording both total and pure computation times. Results highlight a "Goldilocks zone" of optimal granularity, balancing overhead with parallel efficiency. Notably, worker failures often improved performance by reducing resource contention. The system illustrates fault-tolerant parallel computation over tuple space and suggests future enhancements such as shared memory models and regex-based tuple queries.
